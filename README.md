# BrunchReactExample

## it is just a reminder how to setup Brunch.io with:
  - reactjs
  - postcss
  - mobservable (it was not quite smooth, had to update to 2.3.2 to work)

files:
  - package.json
  - brunch-config.js

Still, I think webpack with hot-reloading is much more convenient for SPA development. :)


To start your Phoenix app:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phoenix.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
